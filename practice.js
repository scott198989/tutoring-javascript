// ARRAYS

// Consider the variable:

var groceryList = ["chips", "dip", "cookies"]

// Write the code that will add "soda" to the end of the original array.

// Write the code that will add "granola" to the end of array without altering the original array.

// Write the code that will add "beans" to the "chips" and "dip" array.

// Consider the variable:

var numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

// Write the code that will add the number 0 to the beginning of the array.

// Write the code that will add the number 12 to the end of the array.

// Write the code that will remove the first number from the array.

// Write the code that will add the number 0 to the beginning of the array without altering the original array. HINT: it's not .unshift You'll have to get creative! ;)

// Consider the variable:

var numSet = [2, 13, 6, 8, 4, 2]

// Write the code that finds the index of the first appearance of the number 2.

// Write the code that finds the index of the last appearance of the number 2.

// Write the code that returns the number at the third index.

// Consider the variable:

var characters = ["y", "a", "r", "r", "a"]

// LOOPS

// Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns an array with all numbers multiplied by 3.
const testArr1 = [3, 9, 15, 4, 10]
// output: [9, 27, 45, 12, 30]

// Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array with only odd numbers.
const testArr2 = [0, 2, -7, 3, 5, 8, 10, 13]
// output: [-7, 3, 5, 13]

// Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and letters and returns a string with only the letters. HINT: use the typeof method.
const comboArr = [
  7,
  "n",
  true,

  10,
  "e",
  -388,
  "w",
  3,
